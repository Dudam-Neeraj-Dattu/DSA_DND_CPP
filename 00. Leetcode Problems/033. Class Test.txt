Problem statement
Ninja recently appeared for a class test. The test was attended by ‘N’ students and the marks of each student was given in an array ‘A’.

Ninja knows that he got a rank ‘K’ among the ‘N’ students but forgot the marks achieved by him. The ranks are given according to the better marks scored by the students.

Tell the marks that must have been scored by Ninja to get a rank ‘K’.

Example :
N = 5
K = 3
A = [ 2, 5, 4, 4, 5 ]

Rank 1 and Rank 2 students get marks = 5.
Rank 3 and Rank 4 students get marks = 4.
Rank 5 student gets marks = 2.

So, Ninja must have scored 4 marks in order to achieve Rank = 3.


#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int classTest(int n, vector<int> &a, int k) {
    // Write your code here.
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    vector<int> v;
    for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        v.push_back(a[i]);
    }
    return v[k - 1];
}
