Problem statement
You are standing in queue to buy the latest Batman movie ticket. You noticed the queue looked like a singly LinkedList.

Each person has some amount of money with them, you are bored, and you want to find the amount of money the person is standing at the ‘Kth’ of the queue from the back.

Check examples for better understanding.

Example :
N = 4,  K = 2  
NODE = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
In the following example, the 2nd person from the back has ‘3’ units of money.

---------code-------------

int kthMoney(List *head , int k) {

   // Write your code here.
   vector<int> v;
   while(head) {
      v.push_back(head -> data);
      head = head -> next;
   }
   return v[v.size() - k];
}
