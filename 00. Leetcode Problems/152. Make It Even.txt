You are the most disciplined ninja of Leaf Village. You love when an array is also ‘Disciplined.’ An array is considered ‘Disciplined’ when all array elements are EVEN.

You are given an integer ‘N’ and an array ‘ARR’ consisting of ‘N’ integers. Your task is to convert ‘ARR’ into a ‘Disciplined’ array with the following moves.

In one move you can pick any index ‘i’ (0 <= i <= ‘N-1’) and increment the ‘i-th’ element of ‘ARR’ by 1. Find the minimum number of moves required to convert ‘ARR’ into ‘Disciplined’ array.

Example :
N = 4    
ARR = [ 2 , 1 , 4 , 6 ]

If you increment 1 (‘i’ = 1), the array becomes [ 2, 2, 4, 6 ]. Now the array is ‘Disciplined’ because all elements are even.  So the answer is 1.

int makeItEven(int n , vector <int> &arr){
    // Write your code here.
    int count = 0;
    for(int i : arr) {
        if(i & 1) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
